Drum kit.

This is my interpretation of the first exercise that is part of the 30 js challenge (https://javascript30.com/).

It consists on a basic drum kit of eight different sounds. To play a sound, you have to press a letter on your keyboard as indicated on the website. So for example, if you press the key "h" it will play the sound called "tom" that is related to that specific letter.

For this project I used: HTML 5, CSS 3, CSS Grid, Javascript.

Thank you for reading and enjoy!
